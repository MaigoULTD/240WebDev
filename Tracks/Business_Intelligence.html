			<h1>Business Intelligence</h1>
          
                <br>
                <p>The IT major is designed to offer a top notch program that addresses the Commonwealth’s IT workforce needs through collaboration between CM and CSM. This degree provides a pathway from the bachelor’s degree to IT position in the public and private sectors, profit, and nonprofit.
                <br><br>    
                Exercises assigned throughout the BSIT are designed to be the kind that a student might encounter in his or her work: collaboration, competence, and outcomes assessment are the hallmark characteristics of the program.
                <br><br>
                Business Intelligence (BI) is the technology that companies such as Amazon.com and Google use to take advantage of the enormous amount of data they collect and analyze. It is the technology with which Amazon.com knows what book to recommend you every time you login, Google knows how to rank the pages you are searching for, and banks decide whether to approve loan applications almost instantly. As organizations increasingly have to deal with “big data,” the number of job openings and the need for skilled professionals in this field will continue to increase.<p/>

                <center>
                This is a technology-driven method where data are analyzed, information is executed, and business decisions are made with respect to the collected data and information.
