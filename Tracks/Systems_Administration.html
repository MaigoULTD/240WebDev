                <p>
                    System Administrators focuses on the deployment and maintenance of computer systems and networks. The system administration track concerns issues related to the selection, installation, configuration and maintenance of Linux- and Windows-based systems (including shell programming and scripting, heterogeneous systems, remote management, the legal issues of system administration, as well as the design and implementation of policies and automated administration regimes) and Internet-working environments. As organizations keep investing in their information systems, talents are needed to help design, deploy, manage, and safeguard these systems.
