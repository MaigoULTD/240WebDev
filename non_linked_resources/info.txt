About BSIT program: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology is a program provided by College of Management(CM) and College of Science and Mathematics(CSM). The program provides a quality education that focuses on the skills and knowledge needed by a diverse group of students to advancement and to pursue advanced degrees in information technology.
Learning Objectives: 
Develop strengths in all aspects of information technology and acquire knowledge, abilities, and hands-on skills that are valuable to employers in a market. Also, our course is designed in such a way that reinforces core business skills like: project management, business communications, group dynamics, and organization skills.
IT tracks and majors:
 The IT major consists of a common core of ten courses, a track of four to six courses in a particular area of specialization (the business intelligence track requires five courses), a common capstone course, and three to five professional electives.There are four IT tracks and majors:
Some of the major tracks of IT are as follows:
1) Computing Forensic:
This track focuses on collecting data and presenting in a digital way for preventing/ resolving crime. Computer is being used for committing crimes and the need for experts to extract useful information from computer evidence is very much in demand.
Courses Required:
Sociology104 Intro to Criminal Justice
The course focuses on giving students a theoretical and empirical foundation of the criminal justice system. Topics will also include the nature of victimization, the inner workings of the criminal justice system and the outcomes for offenders leaving the system. This course is offered both in fall and spring.
IT 220 Computer Forensics I
This course looks specifically at how one obtains evidence off of a computer, other digital devices and from network messages and logs, preserving the evidentiary chain, and the legal aspects of the search and seizure of computers and related equipment/information. This course is offered in spring.
